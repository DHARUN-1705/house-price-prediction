## ⚙️ Model Used
- Linear Regression

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Check for missing values
3. Perform feature scaling
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate using MSE and R² score
7. Analyze feature coefficients
8. Visualize residual errors

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
